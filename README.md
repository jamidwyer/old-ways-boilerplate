# Old Ways Boilerplate

Want plain HTML, JS, and CSS like in the olden days?

## Dev

`npm install`
`npm run start`

Change files as needed.

## Deploy

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/) is amazing. Sadly, I get no money for saying so.

## TODO

Make a generator.
